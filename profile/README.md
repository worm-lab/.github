Here at the worm-lab at the University of Cologne we study all kinds of vermiform animals, with a strong focus on the roundworms (phylum Nematoda).

Under the umbrella of research in ecology, evolution and/of development our goal is to:
- understand why roundworms are locked into a vermiform Bauplan;
- study their biodiversity in the face of climate change and learn how some of them can thrive without sex; and last but not least
- to fight the parasitic worms causing neglected tropical diseases.

We are always open for collaborations and we love to talk to everyone about our science, so please don't hesitate to get in touch through any of the channels listed below. Also if you want to work with us, maybe have a crazy cool idea for a research project, please get in touch as well.
